# Running YOLO (from a web cam) with SKIL

To run the examples in this folder, first download the TensorFlow YOLOv2 model pre-trained on COCO from
our [test resources here](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-test-resources/blob/681a0cf2e9edb62c88a5dc41f7516e3b1dff3f19/src/main/resources/tf_graphs/examples/yolov2_608x608/frozen_model.pb)
Make sure to save this model as `yolo_v2.pb` in this folder (tensorflow-yolo). After that, simply
start a SKIL instance and run one of the examples.
